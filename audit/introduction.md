Assumption is that a project being on both Gitbook and Github means the Gitbook and Github are in sync.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Unknown in Status means that is unknown if the project has a Github repo, and if it is synced with the Gitbook space.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Collection in Published means that the project space is published, but as part of a collection.
{% endhint %}

Create sub-pages for each project in a collection detailing the audit and status.
